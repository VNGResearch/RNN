**This project is built upon  [Part 4 of the WildML RNN Tutorial](http://www.wildml.com/2015/10/recurrent-neural-network-tutorial-part-4-implementing-a-grulstm-rnn-with-python-and-theano/)**. The previous parts are here:

- [Recurrent Neural Networks Tutorial, Part 1 – Introduction to RNNs](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/)
- [Recurrent Neural Networks Tutorial, Part 2 – Implementing a RNN with Python, Numpy and Theano](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-2-implementing-a-language-model-rnn-with-python-numpy-and-theano/)
- [Recurrent Neural Networks Tutorial, Part 3 – Backpropagation Through Time and Vanishing Gradients](http://www.wildml.com/2015/10/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-3-backpropagation-through-time-and-vanishing-gradients/)
